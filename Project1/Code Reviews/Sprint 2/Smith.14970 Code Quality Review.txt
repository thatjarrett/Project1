Sprint 2

File is functional and does a great job of piecing together all the parts of link. There are some things we can probably 
extract out in a later sprint, like the declaration of the projectile sprites that link has, but overall it is a great start
to being able to understand the file all in one place. The file does do a good job of spreading out the work of many classes
and sprites, and is only held back by being the class that declares all of those sprites.
