Review: The code is a decent implemetnation of the skeleton class. The code is clean and easy to read.
I don't know if the damage function works due to enemies not being able to be damaged yet, but it looks like it should work.
Animation could be improved to look a bit less wonky, but it is functional. The implementation should allow for this to be done easily.
