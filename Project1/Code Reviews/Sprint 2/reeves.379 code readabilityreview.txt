This file is easy to read, as the comments are very helpful for readability and explain some of the things that aren't entirely obvious if the code was plain.
Some of the comments are a bit unenecessary, but they don't detract from the readability of the code. The code is well written and easy to follow, and the logic is sound.
I would remove some of the commented out lines to make the code a bit cleaner, but it is a minor issue. The code is very well done and I have no issues with it.
This review took 5 minutes to write.
