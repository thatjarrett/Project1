Sprint 2

This file is easy to read, with the exclusion of a Draw function that appears to be unused. It may be there for the purpose of satisfying ISprite, but without a check the inclusion seems confusing.
Aside from that, given the relatively straightforward implementation of the sprite drawing, the code is easy to follow and understand.
