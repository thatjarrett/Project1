Review: Overall, the file is very straightforward and relativeley easily to comprehend. While some parts rely on outside methods, the functions
of thse can generally be inferred via context clues, or found by looking at the corresponding methods. The only thing I wasn't really clear on was
the function of the "gameOverTriggered" variable, but otherwise everything else made sense easily.
