Sprint 2

This file is well written in the regard that it's clear each method within the class serves one function, meaning a good level of conciseness is at play. My only notable concern
is there's a small amount of logic within Draw, which may possibly be better fit in its own method.

As a whole though, the functions of this class are simple, and easy to read, and their function is clear and to the point.
