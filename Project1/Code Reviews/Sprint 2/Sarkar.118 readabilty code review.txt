Sprint 2

Though not neccesarily noticable when viewing the file outright, looking at the implementation of the various objects that inherit the environmentTile
class, it becomes clear that the way the code is written is able to significantly lessen the work needed to create objects of type environmentTile.

The code will not need to be changed much in order to be maintained, though this is in part due to the fact that tiles have very few functionalities.
However, I can imagine that implementing special "function specific" features for certain tiles might be problematic. Those specific tiles could
be moved to a separate class, perhaps.
