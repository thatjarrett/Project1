Sprint 2

Review: Functionally, this interface appears to have all of the functions that would possibly be needed for any given enemy, and the enemies created thus far which do depend
on this interface work perfectly fine. There seems to be very few, and primitive fields for each method, hopefully ensuring we have no issues with dependencies later on. I
overall think this interface is neat and orderly, and doesn't appear to have any redundancies.
