Sprint 5

This function adds a really cool new enemy to our game that we didn't have before.
It has unique behavior with the charge attack, and the implementation is really clean and easy to understand.
The enemy has a unique attack that is different from the other enemies, and it is easy to understand how it works.
The enemy also has a unique loot table, dropping a triforce piece, which is a really cool addition to the game.
The sprite management is done really well, even though that was a hard learning curve for our team, and the enemy is a cool addition overall.
