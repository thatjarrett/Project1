Sprint 5

PortalManager initially had some issues with the sprite work which I resolved. Namely, sprites were actually rectangle objects rather than ISprites, which led to a multitude
of issues. Firstly, it broke the standard of sprites established, and secondly, sprites would not draw correctly due to scale issues (and issues regarding the aforementioned
standards established with using ISprites). After fixing these issues, I have few issues with the class. The functions are very concise, plenty of them taking up only one
line. Each function seems to properly only serve one purpose. Overall a well written class that serves its purpose well.
