Game1 is getting pretty full and is becoming hard to follow, there is much evidence of editing to the point where several spots no longer follow the general standards
for indentation. However, the code makes solid use of methods to pull functionality out and sort it effectively. this Greatly offsets the other difficulties that exist in reading the code
Overall it is a solid program.
