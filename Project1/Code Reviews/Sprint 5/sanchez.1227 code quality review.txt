I think it was a really good idea to create a separate class for locked doors since they surprisingly have a lot of different functionality when compared to normal
static doors. I updated the opening function to correspond to the direction that the door is facing. However, this added the use of quite a few magic numbers which
most likely could have been avoided by using constants for the collision box dimensions instead.
