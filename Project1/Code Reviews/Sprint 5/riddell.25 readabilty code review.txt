Portal projectile is an easy to read class composed of a set of functions, plenty of which take up only one line. The longer functions are decently concise with simple
if else logic. There aren't any instances of confusing numbers or overly nested logic, as such, this class is highly readable and concise, serving the purpose it needs to serve.
