Sprint 5

The loot tables class is pretty easy to read since it mainly consists of simply branching logic from random integers to determine item spawns. I think it code be changed to
just return the ramdom number generated and have that correspond with loot items itself rather than having a separate lootid variable, but overall the introduction of a
second variable does not make it much harder read or understand.
