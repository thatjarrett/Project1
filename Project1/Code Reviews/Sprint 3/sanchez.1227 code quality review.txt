Sprint 3

Review: I think the code is quite readable due to the use of case-switch blocks and grouping the initialization code by category of block. I had to work with 
this file in order to debug some issues with the walls of the dungeon and it was really easy to see how the class worked as a whole and what was going wrong.
There are some comments that I suspect are no longer needed and were mosat likely used by Bennett while he was writing the class. Othen than that though, I think
the code is readable and well done.
