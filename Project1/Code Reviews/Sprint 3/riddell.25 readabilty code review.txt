Sprint 3

This class has a high level of readability, with each method having a single, clear function, written in only a few lines each. Each method appears to only do one task, and that
task it performs is well described by the name of the method. Each method also has a few number of arguments, so it is clear what is passed into each function, and what role each
passed in value plays.
