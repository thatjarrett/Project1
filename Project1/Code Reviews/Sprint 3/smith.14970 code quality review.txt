Sprint 3

Everyone did a great job getting work done quickly. Level loading revealed a few bugs with other sections of the code, but it will be easy to resolve those issues after 
meeting in class tomorrow. We have a solid team that is good at finishing jobs when the deadline is approaching. There was some mess in Game1 prior to level loading that 
took some time to clean up, but I think the final result is rather elegant and Game1 is a much cleaner class now.
