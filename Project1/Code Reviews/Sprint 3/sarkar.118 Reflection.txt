Sprint Reflection
Sprint 3
3/6/2025

Overall, I think we got a lot of things done in a productive manner. Nobody really seemed to have a hard time working on their parts of the
assignment, which is a good thing. However, I feel like the tasks assigned to everyone were a bit arbitrary (though this is probably in part due
to the structure of the sprint), and because of how we tackled the sprint, some people had to wait for others to finish their parts before they
were able to begin working.
