Review: I think the code was really well done for this file since it essential acts as a header file for all the entities in the game. 
It doesn't seem to have any pieces that are redundant or unneeded and also helps by clearing code out of Game1.cs. I dont think the file
will need much updating as long as we don't add more items/entities. I did make an addition to the code by using the tileID to center items
based on their size grouping.
