Sprint 3

Review: The code is a great implementation of the collision box mechanics. With collision for different sides, solid math, and drawing rectangles for debug purposes the code
is very well done. Though the complexity is a little bit high, for the purposes of our project the code seems to work perfectly well without significant performance issues. 
The one time performance issues were a problem, it turned out to be the debug print statements that caused it, so with the removal of them, our project runs much smoother.
