Sprint Reflection
Sprint 3
3/5/2025

This sprint went relatively smoothly for our group, with tasks being distributed and agreed upon as soon as the Sprint began, and individuals began work on their part of the Sprint
almost as soon as they could. We had great results in the realm of communication and cooperation, which greatly helped the speed of our work. The only notable technical problem
were strange interactions with Link taking damage from invisible enemies. However, once level loading is fully, properly implemented, this shouldn't be a problem. We did identify
a very slight downside in terms of our Jira board, in the terms of clarity. While people can properly identify when they start and end a task, for broad tasks like level loading,
there is a very low level of clarity on how much progress exactly has been made.

Overall though, we worked efficiently and effectively this sprint, and overall we are happy with our work, and don't have any comments in regards to how we'd change work in future 
sprints.
