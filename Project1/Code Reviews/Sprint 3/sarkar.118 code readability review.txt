Reviewing Level.cs

Sprint 3

Review: There are some commented out lines that should be deleted, and a few redundant lines of code at the start, but other than that the
program does what is expected of it, without being overly complex. Moreover, as the code is dependent on other files, the file will only ever need to
be updated if the functionality of level creation requires changing. Thus, I believe Level.cs to be well made.
