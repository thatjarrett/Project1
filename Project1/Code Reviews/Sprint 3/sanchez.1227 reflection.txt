Sprint Reflection
Sprint 3
3/7/2025

I think this sprint went quite well as the team was able to learn from how we all work together based on our habits during the last sprint. There did seem
to be quite a few bugs with the collisions as they got added to enemies, items, and tiles since they all had to interact with each other. However, I think the
team did a good job communicating what exactly was going wrong and when they needed help. I think we made good enough progress on this sprint so that we can finish
strong for the last two.
