Sprint 4

The skeleton is even better than ever before with a new method dedicated to dropping items after the enemy dies.
The loot table is relatively simple, but the implementation is robust and definitely works for what we need it to do.
The logic for the skeleton is also simple, with many stub methods, which keeps our code clean and understandable, maintaining a high quality standard. 
We also now have enemy health implemented, meaning that it can take more than one hit, tracking its health while Link fights it.
