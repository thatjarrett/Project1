Sprint 4

When editing this file to work with bombable walls and implement that functionality, I was thuroughly impressed with how readable and easy to process the file was.
I thought initially that adding that functionality would be a technically intense and difficult task, but the file was easy to parse and understand.
The file has a convenient dictionary at the bottom that makes understanding what blocks correspond to certain numbers rather easy, and I was easily able to understand where bombable walls would fit. 
I was also impressed with how easy it was to add new cases for the bombable walls and was able to load them easily too.
This file is a really good example of modular code, and how new code can be added onto it even after the primary functionalities are complete.
