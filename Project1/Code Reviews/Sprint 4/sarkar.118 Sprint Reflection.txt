Sprint 4
4/7/2025

While I think I objectively got a lot done, this sprint felt shorter and more uneventful than previous ones. I can't shake the feeling that I
actually got LESS done this sprint, despite that probably not being the case. Overall, the sprint did not feel particularly challenging, which
might be why I feel the way I do about it.
