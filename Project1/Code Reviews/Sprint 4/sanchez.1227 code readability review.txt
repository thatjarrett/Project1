Review: This class is pretty well-organized and clearly lays out the level setup and building processes. It was confusing at first to wrap my head around
the coordinate system for rooms since its an inverted axis, but once I was able to get around that, the code was pretty easy to follow. I like how it also
separates responsibilities between tiles and entities, which helps in making it easy to read.
