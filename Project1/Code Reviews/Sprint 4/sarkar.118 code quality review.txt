The file overall does a good job of avoiding magic numbers. Moreover, while some of the methods are slightly long, this is the result of necessity,
and they are not any longer than they NEED to be. Lastly, the file easily builds off the environmentTile class, and as a result, most of the code
in it is just stuff that is not handled by the parent class.
