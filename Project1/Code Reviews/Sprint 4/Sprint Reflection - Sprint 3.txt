Sprint Reflection
Sprint 4
4/X/2025

Jarrett- This sprint went well overall, with meaningful progress made on core features, but it definitely presented some challenges. 
Toward the end, we found ourselves with a lot of work left to complete, which created a time crunch.
This was largely due to some procrastination earlier in the sprint, which we’ll need to address in the final sprint to make sure we're complete.
The technical demands of this sprint were pretty high too, involving more complex logic and more bugfixing, which naturally made the work more difficult.
However, this also pushed us to improve our understanding of the code and use more collaboration in difficult parts.
While the sprint had its rough patches, it was productive even though other classes were also taking up a lot of our time.
