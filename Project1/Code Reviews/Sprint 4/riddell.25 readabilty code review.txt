Sprint 4

This class has a moderate level of readability, with each method having a single, clear function, written in only a few lines each. Each method appears to only do one task, and that
task it performs is well described by the name of the method. Each method also has a few number of arguments, so it is clear what is passed into each function, and what role each
passed in value plays However, there are some readability issues when it comes to values used in different functions. Namely, there are a lot of loose Magic Numbers scattered
throughout the class, which at some points make it look like a chalkboard in a math class. There's definitely work to do in terms of consolidating values into constants.
